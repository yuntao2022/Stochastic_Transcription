    "Note that we only time one final execution of `expm_multiply(A * t , p0)`, which calculates the product $\\exp{(tA)}p(0)$. Matrix $A$, or equivalently the subset of states, is determined such that the truncation error, defined as $1-\\pmb{1}^T\\exp{(tA)}p(0)$, is below the prescribed tolerance $\\epsilon=1e-5$. Therefore, the preceding iterative process of expanding the state subset (or equivalently the matrix $A$) to achieve this error bound is excluded from the timing. "
